          <h3>Defense of the respiratory system</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> 
           Exposed as it is to the outside environment, the respiratory tract possesses a complicated but comprehensive series of defenses against inhaled material.
           As air passes through the nose, large particles of debris are filtered out by cilia and by mucus that is secreted from the mucous membrane lining the
           nasal cavity. The air then travels through the pharynx, which is the last portion of the upper airway, through the larynx, which is the beginning portion
           of the lower airways, and into the trachea. Further filtration of the air occurs as it passes over cilia and sticky layers of mucus in the trachea. In addition,
           lymphatic vessels in the wall of the trachea transport cells of the immune system, such as lymphocytes and macrophages, that act to trap and destroy foreign
           particles. Bands of muscle that surround the cartilage of the trachea play an important role in narrowing the airway during coughing, thus providing a forceful 
           defense mechanism by which sputum and other substances can be quickly expelled from the respiratory tract.<br>
