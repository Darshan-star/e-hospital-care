          feel warm, or be painful. Through your blood, the infection can also spread to other parts of your body. 
          This is referred to as disseminated black fungus (mucormycosis). When this occurs, the fungus can attack
          organs such as your spleen and heart. In severe cases, you may experience mental changes or fall into a 
          coma. It can even be fatal.</p2>

     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> 
          Black fungus (mucormycosis) is a complication caused by a fungal infection. People catch mucormycosis 
          by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also occur in the skin once the 
          fungus enters through a cut, scrape, burn, or another sort of skin damage.</p2>

          Mucormycosis is a potentially fatal condition that causes blurred or double vision, chest pain, and breathing difficulties. 
         It is most common in COVID-19 patients.</p2>

          Immunosuppressive therapy, and patients in ICU for a long time, on oxygen therapy and with high ferritin are all high-risk categories

          <p2> 
          Mucormycosis is caused by a kind of mould known as a mucormycete. It may be present in the air, water, and even food. It enters

          <h3>Why are black fungus infections increasing?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> 
          The rise in black fungus infections has been linked to an overuse of steroids in the treatment of coronavirus, 
          which can severely weaken the immune system if used for a long time.</p2>
     </div>

          <h3>Can black fungus be treated at home?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> 
          The medication needed to cure the virus could not be obtained from a medical shop since it could not be treated at home.</p2>

 <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>What does black fungus do?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> 
          Local infections can occur if the fungus enters the body through a wound or burn. However, if it enters the body through
          the sinus, it can impact the eyes and, eventually, the brain, resulting in a deadly condition.</p2>

          <h3>Are these infections life-threatening?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> 
          These illnesses are extremely dangerous, and most people will die if they are remaining untreated.
          The death rate ranges from 25% to 90%. Once the infection has gone to the brain, the fatality rate is 
          quite high. As a result, early diagnosis and fast treatment are given a high priority.</p2>
