<h1><b><u>Flu & Cold</b></u></h1>
<p1> <br>  
    Influenza is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs.
    Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach "flu" viruses that cause diarrhea 
    and vomiting.<br>

           commonly known as the "flu," is an extremely contagious respiratory illness
           caused by influenza A or B viruses. Flu appears most frequently in winter and early spring. 
           The flu virus attacks the body by spreading through the upper and/or lower respiratory tract.</p2>

          <h3>Reasons why People Fall ILL during Season Change?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2> Many people usually come down with flu or cold as the season changes.
          We usually think that it is because of the change in temperature and weather. 
          However, according to experts, temperature change is not the direct causes illnesses. 
          The temperature shifts actually permit a new group of viruses to flourish, and these viruses that
          make people sick.</p2>

          There are four FDA-approved antiviral drugs recommended by CDC to treat flu this season.<br>
          1.Oseltamivir phosphate (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®),<br>
          2.Zanamivir (trade name Relenza®)<br>
          3.Peramivir (trade name Rapivab®), and.<br>

          <h3>What's the difference between a cold and flu?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>The common cold and flu are both contagious viral infections of the respiratory tract. 
          Although the symptoms can be similar, flu is much worse. A cold may drag you down a bit, but the flu
          can make you shudder at the very thought of getting out of bed.<br><br>

          Congestion, sore throat, and sneezing are common with colds. Both cold and flu may bring coughing 
          (less common), headache, and chest discomfort. With the flu, though, you are likely to run a high fever
          for several days and have body aches, fatigue, and weakness. Symptoms of the flu also tend to come on abruptly. 
          Usually, complications from colds are relatively minor, but a case of flu can lead to a life-threatening illness
          such as pneumonia.<br><br>
          More than 100 types of cold viruses are known, and new strains of flu evolve every few years. Since both diseases 
          are viral, antibiotics cannot conquer cold or flu. Remember: Antibiotics only treat bacterial infections.<br><br>

          Four antiviral medications are available to treat flu. But there are no medications that specifically defeat the
          common cold. Antibiotics may be helpful only if there is a secondary bacterial infection.<br><br>

          <h3>How is flu spread?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>"The flu virus is spread from person to person through respiratory secretions and typically sweeps through large
          groups of people who spend time in close contact, such as in daycare facilities, classrooms, college dormitories, 
          military barracks, offices, and nursing homes.<br><br>

          Flu is spread when you inhale droplets in the air that contain the flu virus, make direct contact with respiratory 
          secretions through sharing drinks or utensils, or handle items contaminated by an infected person. In the latter case, the flu
          virus on your skin can infect you when you touch or rub your eyes, nose, or mouth. That's why frequent and thorough handwashing 
          is a key way to limit the spread of influenza. Flu symptoms start to develop from one to four days after infection with the virus.</p2>

          <h3>How are stomach flu and influenza different?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>"Stomach flu" is a popular term, but not a true medical diagnosis. It's not uncommon to mistake 
          gastroenteritis, which is what stomach flu is, for the viral infection we commonly call the "flu." 
          Gastroenteritis refers to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines). Viruses are the 
          most common cause of stomach flu. With gastroenteritis, you may have symptoms such as fever, abdominal cramps, 
          nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.<br><br>
