          <h3>What is Covid-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.  WHO first learned of this
          new virus on 31 December 2019, following a report of a cluster of cases of ‘viral pneumonia’ in 
          Wuhan, People’s Republic of China.</p2>

          <h3>What Happens to people who get COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Among those who develop symptoms, most (about 80%) recover from the
           disease without needing hospital treatment. About 15% become seriously 
           ill and require oxygen and 5% become critically ill and need intensive care.<br><br>

           Complications leading to death may include respiratory failure, acute 
           respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, thromboembolism, 
           and/or multiorgan failure, including injury of the heart, liver or kidneys.<br><br>

           In rare situations, children can develop a severe inflammatory syndrome a 
           few weeks after infection. </p2>
     </div>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>Who is most at risk of severe illess from COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>People aged 60 years and over, and those with underlying medical
           problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, 
           obesity or cancer, are at higher risk of developing serious illness.<br><br> 

           However, anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill 
           or die at any age. </p2>
     </div>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>Are there long-term effects of COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Some people who have had COVID-19, whether they have needed
          hospitalization or not, continue to experience symptoms, including
          fatigue, respiratory and neurological symptoms.<br><br>

          WHO is working with our Global Technical Network for Clinical Management
          of COVID-19, researchers and patient groups around the world to design 
          and carry out studies of patients beyond the initial acute course of illness
          to understand the proportion of patients who have long term effects, how 
          long they persist, and why they occur.  These studies will be used to develop 
          further guidance for patient care. </p2>

          <h3>How can we protect others and ourselves if we don't know who is infected?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing,
          wearing a mask, especially when distancing cannot be maintained, keeping 
          rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds and close contact, regularly cleaning 
          your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice where 
          you live and work. Do it all!<br><br>

          Read our public advice page for more information.</p2>
     </div>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>When should I get a test for COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible. People who do 
          not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be, 
          infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and 
          follow their guidance.<br><br>  

          While a person is waiting for test results, they should remain isolated from
          others. Where testing capacity is limited, tests should first be done for those 
          at higher risk of infection, such as health workers, and those at higher risk of
          severe illness such as older people, especially those living in seniors’ 
          residences or long-term care facilities.</p2>
     </div>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>What test should I get to see if I have COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>In most situations, a molecular test is used to detect SARS-CoV-2 and confirm 
          infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most commonly used molecular test. 
          Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. Molecular tests 
          detect virus in the sample by amplifying viral genetic material to detectable levels. 
          For this reason, a molecular test is used to confirm an active infection, usually within 
          a few days of exposure and around the time that symptoms may begin.</p2>
     </div>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>What about rapid test?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Rapid antigen tests (sometimes known as a rapid diagnostic test – RDT) detect viral 
           proteins (known as antigens). Samples are collected from the nose and/or throat with a swab. 
           These tests are cheaper than PCR and will offer results more quickly, although they are 
           generally less accurate. These tests perform best when there is more virus circulating in
           the community and when sampled from an individual during the time they are most infectious. </p2>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>I want to find out if I had COVID-19 in the past, what test could I take?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Antibody tests can tell us whether someone has had an infection in the past, even if they have
          not had symptoms. Also known as serological tests and usually done on a blood sample, these tests 
          detect antibodies produced in response to an infection. In most people, antibodies start to develop 
          after days to weeks and can indicate if a person has had past infection. Antibody tests cannot be 
          used to diagnose COVID-19 in the early stages of infection or disease but can indicate whether or not 
          someone has had the disease in the past.</p2>
     </div>

     <div class="accordion">
          <div class="icon"></div>
          <h3>What is the difference between isolation and quarantine?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Both isolation and quarantine are methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19.<br><br>

          <b>Quarantine</b> is used for anyone who is a contact of someone infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
          which causes COVID-19, whether the infected person has symptoms or not. Quarantine means that you 
          remain separated from others because you have been exposed to the virus and you may be infected and 
          can take place in a designated facility or at home. For COVID-19, this means staying in the facility 
          or at home for 14 days.<br><br>

          <b>Isolation</b> is used for people with COVID-19 symptoms or who have tested positive for the virus.
          Being in isolation means being separated from other people, ideally in a medically facility where you
          can receive clinical care.  If isolation in a medical facility is not possible and you are not in a high
          risk group of developing severe disease, isolation can take place at home. If you have symptoms, you 
          should remain in isolation for at least 10 days plus an additional 3 days without symptoms. If you are 
          infected and do not develop symptoms, you should remain in isolation for 10 days from the time you test 
          positive. </p2>

          <h3>What should I do if I have been exposed to someone who has COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>If you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you may become infected, even if you feel well.<br><br>

          After exposure to someone who has COVID-19, do the following:<br><br>

           1. Call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline to find out where and when to get a test.<br>
           2. Cooperate with contact-tracing procedures to stop the spread of the virus.<br>
           3. If testing is not available, stay home and away from others for 14 days.<br>
           4. While you are in quarantine, do not go to work, to school or to public places. Ask someone to bring you supplies.<br>
           5.Keep at least a 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.<br>
           6.Wear a medical mask to protect others, including if/when you need to seek medical care.<br>
           7.Clean your hands frequently.<br>
           8.Stay in a separate room from other family members, and if not possible, wear a medical mask.<br>
           9.Keep the room well-ventilated.<br>
          10.If you share a room, place beds at least 1 metre apart.<br>
          11.Monitor yourself for any symptoms for 14 days.<br> 
          12.Stay positive by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising at home.<br><br>
        If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical help if you have a fever. While travelling to and from the health 
        facility and during medical care, wear a mask, keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching surfaces with your 
        hands. This applies to adults and children. Read our malaria and COVID-19 Q&A for more information. </p2>

          <h3>How long does it take to develop symptoms?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>The time from exposure to COVID-19 to the moment when symptoms begin is, on average, 5-6 days and can range from 1-14 days. 
          This is why people who have been exposed to the virus are advised to remain at home and stay away from others, for 14 days, 
          in order to prevent the spread of the virus, especially where testing is not easily available.</p2>

          <h3>Is there a vaccine for COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Yes. The first mass vaccination programme started in early December 2020 and the number of vaccination doses administered 
          is updated on a daily basis here. At least 13 different vaccines (across 4 platforms) have been administered. Campaigns 
          have started in 206 economies.<br><br>

          The Pfizer/BioNtech Comirnaty vaccine was listed for WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) on 31 December 2020. The SII/Covishield
          and AstraZeneca/AZD1222 vaccines (developed by AstraZeneca/Oxford and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and SK Bio 
          respectively) were given EUL on 16 February. The Janssen/Ad26.COV 2.S developed by Johnson & Johnson, was listed for EUL on 12 
          March 2021. The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (mRNA 1273) was listed for EUL on 30 April 2021 and the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine was 
          listed for EUL on 7 May 2021. The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, subsidiary
          of China National Biotec Group (CNBG).<br><br>

          For further information, see here.<br><br>

          Once vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, they must be approved by national regulators, manufactured to exacting
          standards, and distributed. WHO is working with partners around the world to help coordinate key steps in this process, including 
          to facilitate equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for the billions of people who will need them. More information 
          about COVID-19 vaccine development is available here.</p2>

     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>If you have any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, call your health care provider or COVID-19 hotline for instructions and 
          find out when and where to get a test, stay at home for 14 days away from others and monitor your health.<br><br>

          If you have shortness of breath or pain or pressure in the chest, seek medical attention at a health facility immediately.
          Call your health care provider or hotline in advance for direction to the right health facility.<br><br>

          If you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever, seek medical care if you have a fever.<br><br>

          If local guidance recommends visiting a medical centre for testing, assessment or isolation, wear a medical mask while travelling
          to and from the facility and during medical care. Also keep at least a 1-metre distance from other people and avoid touching 
          surfaces with your hands.  This applies to adults and children.</p2>

          <h3>Are there treatments for COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.<br><br>

          Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for
          severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.<br><br>

          Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives
          of patients with severe and critical illness. Read our dexamethasone Q&A for more information.<br><br>  

          Results from the WHO’s Solidarity Trial indicated that remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon
          regimens appear to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or the in-hospital course of COVID-19 among hospitalized
          patients.<br><br>

          Hydroxychloroquine has not been shown to offer any benefit for treatment of COVID-19. Read our hydroxychloroquine Q&A for 
          more information.<br><br>

          WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.
          WHO is coordinating efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 and will continue to provide new information as it becomes 
          available.</p2>

          <h3>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?</h3>
     </div>
     <div class="panel">
          <p2>Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus,
          so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19.<br><br>

          In hospitals, physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can 
          be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat 
          a bacterial infection.</p2>
